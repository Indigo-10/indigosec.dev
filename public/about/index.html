<p>hey!!! thanks for checking this out because who even does blog posts in 2024, apparently computer nerds like myself. anyway, my name is jonathan skeete, a sophomore at penn state; however, you&rsquo;ll see me go by my alias, &ldquo;indigo&rdquo;, practically everywhere else (music production, CTFs, usernames, etc). i&rsquo;ve studied cybersecurity formally since my sophomore year of high school, and, fun fact, i&rsquo;ve inconsistently and incoherently used kali since elementary school (i like to joke that i was born for this). these days, i serve as the red team captain for penn state&rsquo;s competitive cybersecurity organization and spend my free time learning windows exploitation and malware development with the goal of winning a national CPTC title for my team and becoming a professional penetration tester (or APT lol). this blog serves as a journal for anyone interested in the journey or what i do. i think this stuff is pretty cool and i&rsquo;m super passionate about it, so i hope you find this as interesting as i do.</p>
