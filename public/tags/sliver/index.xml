      <description>Background This upcoming spring semester me and a few team members are competing in the Information Security Talent Search (ISTS) Competition hosted by the Rochester Institute of Technology. It is a three-day attack and defend competition, where teams compete in a King of the Hill style challenge by hacking and defending against other teams to keep their critical services such as HTTP, SMTP, and SNMP up for points.&#xA;The competition rules strictly prohibit the use of any anti-virus applications, but as a red-teamer, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you start being noisy and dropping files to disk.</description>
