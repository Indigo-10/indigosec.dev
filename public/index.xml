      <description>Background This upcoming spring semester me and a few team members are competing in the Information Security Talent Search (ISTS) Competition hosted by the Rochester Institute of Technology. It is a three-day attack and defend competition, where teams compete in a King of the Hill style challenge by hacking and defending against other teams to keep their critical services such as HTTP, SMTP, and SNMP up for points.&#xA;The competition rules strictly prohibit the use of any anti-virus applications, but as a red-teamer, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you start being noisy and dropping files to disk.</description>

      <description>hey!!! thanks for checking this out because who even does blog posts in 2024, apparently computer nerds like myself. anyway, my name is jonathan skeete, a sophomore at penn state; however, you&amp;rsquo;ll see me go by my alias, &amp;ldquo;indigo&amp;rdquo;, practically everywhere else (music production, CTFs, usernames, etc). i&amp;rsquo;ve studied cybersecurity formally since my sophomore year of high school, and, fun fact, i&amp;rsquo;ve inconsistently and incoherently used kali since elementary school (i like to joke that i was born for this).</description>
