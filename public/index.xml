      <description>High-level Overview ðŸ“œ Phantom is a medium rated Windows machine on Vulnlab. To gain access to the administrator credentials I leveraged null SMB authentication, RID-Cycling, and Resource Based Constrained Delegation with a user that had a MachineAccountQuota of 0.&#xA;Reconnaissance ðŸ“¡ My default Nmap scan returned the following results.&#xA;Command:&#xA;nmap -sVC -T4 -Pn 10.10.112.137 -oN phantom.txt -sVC: Returns version of serivces and runs default NSE script for additional service enmeration such as smb2-security-mode -T4: Allows for faster scannning.</description>

      <description>hey!!! thanks for checking this out because who even does blog posts in 2024, apparently computer nerds like myself. anyway, my name is jonathan skeete, a sophomore at penn state; however, you&amp;rsquo;ll see me go by my alias, &amp;ldquo;indigo&amp;rdquo;, practically everywhere else (music production, CTFs, usernames, etc). i&amp;rsquo;ve studied cybersecurity formally since my sophomore year of high school, and, fun fact, i&amp;rsquo;ve inconsistently and incoherently used kali since elementary school (i like to joke that i was born for this).</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.&#xA;This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
