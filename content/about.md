hey!!! thanks for checking this out because who even does blog posts in 2024, apparently computer nerds like myself. anyway, my name is jonathan skeete, a sophomore at penn state; however, you'll see me go by my alias, "indigo", practically everywhere else (music production, CTFs, usernames, etc). i've studied cybersecurity formally since my sophomore year of high school, and, fun fact, i've inconsistently and incoherently used kali since elementary school (i like to joke that i was born for this). these days, i serve as the red team captain for penn state's competitive cybersecurity organization and spend my free time learning windows exploitation and malware development with the goal of winning a national CPTC title for my team and becoming a professional penetration tester (or APT lol). this blog serves as a journal for anyone interested in the journey or what i do. i think this stuff is pretty cool and i'm super passionate about it, so i hope you find this as interesting as i do.
